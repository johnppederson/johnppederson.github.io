                        single-point energy calculations, and he started to implement analytical force 
                        evaluations so that full simulations could be run with the method. He also 
                        optimized C++ code in Psi4, a popular quantum chemistry package, for UKS 
                        computations, leading to a 7x speedup for small molecules.">
