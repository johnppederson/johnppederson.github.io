                    John P. Pederson is an alumni of the School of Chemical and Biomolecular 
                    Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. At Georgia Tech, he pursued
                    various interests and was an active member of the Honors Program living-learning
                    community, the Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society, and the Georgia Tech Jazz
                    Combos Program. He also worked to be an involved member of the School of Chemical
                    and Biomolecular Engineering, where he volunteered as a Peer Mentor, Student
                    Ambassador, and GT 1000 Team Leader. These on-campus activities provided John
                    with many opportunities to hone his leadership and interpersonal skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Professionally, John has primarily worked in environmental compliance and
                    research. John has eight months of work experience in the municipal wastewater
                    industry, four months of work experience in the water utilities industry, three
                    years of research experience in sustainable flow chemistry, and two years of
                    research experience in computational chemistry. Through his endeavors, John has
                    acquired skills in data analysis, laboratory and process safety, and technical
                    communication. 
                    <br><br>
                    He graduated in December of 2021 and looks forward to pursuing a graduate degree
                    with a focus in theoretical chemistry.
