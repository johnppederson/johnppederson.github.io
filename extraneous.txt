                            QM/MM/PME method. To date, he continues to work on the implementation of

                            physics, picking up statistical mechanics, quantum chemistry, and
                            molecular dynamics during the pandemic period. In this capacity, he
                            learned to perform molecular simulations and electronic structure
                            calculations, and he came to work on his own project in the development
                            of a hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) method employing
                            particle-mesh Ewald (PME) summation to model long-range electrostatics.

                            In addition to his work in method development, John also streamlined the
                            workflow for generating publication-quality graphics of electrochemical
                            systems using the Blender animation suite.

                            In his second summer at Georgia Tech, John became an undergraduate
                            researcher for
                            <a href="https://marder.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Seth
                            Marder</a>,
                            where he helped design a multistep synthesis for an electrochromic
                            compound. In this role, he learned how to perform myriad methods of
                            separation (solvent-solvent extraction), isolation (column chromatography),
                            purification (rotovap, vacuum evaporation, recrystallization), and
                            characterization (TLC, NMR).

                            After two semesters with the ChemFlow VIP Team, John took on a leadership
                            role within the propranolol project. In this capacity, he trained new
                            group members and undergraduate researchers in laboratory protocols and
                            helped to supervise optimization of the batch reaction. He also designed
                            and presented a poster describing the team's research at the 2019
                            National Conference on Undergraduate Research in Kennesaw, Georgia.
                            Furthermore, he helped to present this research at numerous recruitment
                            events and at a reception for the College of Engineering Advisory Board.

                            After January of 2020, John reduced his involvement with the team in order
                            to focus on his research in theoretical chemistry. During this time, he
                            primarily performed simulations to compare the efficacy of the proposed
                            process to produce propranolol in-flow using the Aspen Plus software. This
                            publication is forthcoming.

                            demand for system capable of producing 172 million gallons daily. 
                            Additionally, he created an application to generate interactive 3D graphs
                            to visualize water quality throughout the plant, created a Microsoft
                            Access database of diurnal demand data, and curated countywide blow-off

                            this capacity, John learned to operate flow reactor pumps, prepare
                            synthetic reagents, and perform batch reactions for the protonation of
                            diphenyldiazomethane with benzoic acids. He also helped to

                            using Inkscape and created a video abstract using Adobe Premiere Pro. He
                            also learned how to traverse the body of chemical literature and presented

                            Water System in a laboratory role. As program assistant, John performed
                            water quality tests on wastewater, stormwater, stream water, and
                            industrial discharge samples. In addition to the tests that he learned
                            to perform as an intern, he learned to perform dissolved oxygen and TLV
                            tests and how to prepare dechlorinating solution and fecal coliform
                            culture medium.

                            solids laboratory. Eventually, John came to train and supervise two

                            pH, TSS, turbidity, and fecal coliform. He performed such tests on
                            stormwater and stream water samples, and he also partook in sampling
